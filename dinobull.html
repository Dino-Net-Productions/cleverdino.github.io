    <ul>
        <li>Ability to transfer files larger than 4GB</li>
        <li>Discord-like appearance to differentiate it from Pitbull</li>
        <li>Terminal-based server console</li>
        <li>Enhanced encryption (8192-bit keys)</li>
        <li>Customizable user interface with options to hide channel and user lists</li>
        <li>Based on Pitbull Pro 4.6.2 fork source, with DinoBull-specific enhancements</li>
    </ul>
